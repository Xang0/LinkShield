# My first Dapp

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project was created during Web3 Week, an event that happend for a whole week where was made available 3 video classes teaching what is Web3, what is a blockchain, what is a smart contract and how to build this project you are reading about.

The project is a Dapp created using React and Next.js for front.end, Solidity for the smart contract and web3.js library to communicate with a Ethereum based blockchain.
